## Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate video processing using C code and the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. The script performs the following steps:

1. **Create a Video Clip**: Extracts a specific portion of the video from `vee.mp4` between timestamps 00:30:38 and 00:32:09 to create a shorter video clip named `video_clip.mp4`.
2. **Extract Audio from Video**: Takes the created `video_clip.mp4` and extracts its audio, saving it as `audio_clip.mp3`.
3. **Merge an Image with Audio**: Merges a static image (`raise.png`) with the extracted audio (`audio_clip.mp3`) to generate a final video (`final.mp4`). The resulting video will display the image while playing the audio.

The code executes these steps using system calls to `ffmpeg` in a sequence of tasks. Each task is validated to ensure successful execution. If a command fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

## Steps to Run

### Prerequisites
- Install **ffmpeg**:
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    ```
- Ensure the following files are available in the same directory as the C code:
    - `vee.mp4`: The source video.
    - `raise.png`: The image to merge with the audio.

### Compilation and Execution
1. **Compile the C Program**:
    ```
    make
    ```
2. **Run the Program**:
    ```
    ./clip
    ```

If successful, the script will output a file named `final.mp4`, which combines the static image and the audio clip.

## Conclusion

This program is a simple demonstration of how to use FFmpeg with C for video and audio manipulation. While it works well for basic tasks, there are several ways it can be optimized, made more secure, and enhanced for better user experience and performance.
